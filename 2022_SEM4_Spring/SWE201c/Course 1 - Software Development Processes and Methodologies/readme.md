# Assignment week 3: 
## Project Scenario 1

### Situation: 

Zenith Healthcare is a new company in the market and has launched its product two years ago. The product is loved by clients and is growing in popularity.  The level of product demand was not anticipated, and the current system architecture cannot support the rising demand. To support the anticipated demand, the company needs to re-architect the system and provide the exact same functionality.  Thus, the requirements from the client perspective are very well known and do not need to change.  What needs to be changed in the system to support the growing demand is also well understood.  The product has 4, fairly independent components.   All 4 components need to be re-architected.  Out of the 4, one of them has caused the most pain and the organization could benefit greatly if that component could be replaced first with a new, highly scalable architecture. The work of migrating to a new platform is a tedious job and the deployment of a new system will involve a lot of external communication, managing customer expectations, etc.

The technical architect and one project manager will be working from the corporate headquarters in Germany, but most of the team who will be doing the coding for the migration will be offshore in Belarus. The testing team will also be in Belarus.

### Questions

#### Question 1
What software development methodology would you suggest for this situation and why? 
Step 1: Start analyzing the scenario by identifying the characteristics of this situation and specify the logic behind the selection of characteristics. For example, you may identify "User Needs Unknown" as a characteristic based on statement X, Y, and Z in the scenario.
Step 2: Select a model that best fits the characteristics you identified in step 1.  Justify your choice by providing by the logic behind your selection.  For example,  you may say that since the scenario has characteristics X and Y, models A and B are potential candidates.  Additionally, since the scenario has characteristic Z, model A is the best option.

#### Question 2
Imagine that you were the lead or project manager for this project. For the selected model, take us through a simulated/fictitious journey on how this project will be completed all the way from defining requirements to deployment. You are free to make up characters as you feel appropriate to fit your story. Please watch the video on "Applying Software Development Models" to get an idea. The video stays at a high level, but you can go into further detail as you feel necessary. In your story, please make sure to talk about artifacts and practices followed by the team on this project

#### Question 3
Assume that you are the quality lead or technical lead on this project. What kind of testing would you suggest the team to do? Be sure to justify your answer. To answer this question, first, list down the key things from the use case above that are really important. For e.g. scalability, performance, usability, integration between components, etc. After that, identify what type of testing would you want the team to do to make sure that upgraded product is high quality and deployed defect free. Please refer to the "Testing and Verification" section in module 2. Also, please watch the following videos to learn about various types of testing methods:

#### Question 4
Continuing your role as a quality lead or technical lead for the project. Write a few examples of test cases or a descriptive narrative for what you expect the testing team to use when testing this product. Please refer to the "Testing and Verification" section in module 2. Feel free to make assumptions about the functionality of the system to come up with a scenario.
