I decided to divide our project timeline into 3 phases: Kick-start, Run-up, and Closure. Each part was also divided into many subparts,
and assigned tasks for each member was a hard mission. Fortunately, my teammates were all excellent and they satisfied my needs. 
I had two members who were good at tech(Tung, Khang), so solving technical problems wasn't difficult at all. 
The designing phase was responsible by me and Tung, with other members as the observations. Hai and Trang were good at 
marketing and targeting customers, so I let them handle the things such as self-assessment and customer content. 
There were some delays and obstacles throughout the timeline, but I think it's near-perfect as I planned
