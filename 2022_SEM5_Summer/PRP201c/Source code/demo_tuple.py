# tuple is a sequence of values much like a list. The values stored in a tuple can
# be any type, and they are indexed by integers. The important difference is that
# tuples are IMMUTABLE. Tuples are also COMPARABLE and HASHABLE so we can sort lists
# of them and use tuples as key values in Python dictionaries.

t = 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'
t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')

# To create a tuple with a single element, you have to include the final comma:
t1 = ('a',)
print(type(t1))  # <type 'tuple'>

t2 = ('a')
print(type(t2))  # <type 'str'>

t = tuple()
print(t)  # ()

# If the argument is a sequence (string, list, or tuple), the result of the call to tuple is a tuple with the elements of the sequence:
t = tuple('lupins')
print(t)  # ('l', 'u', 'p', 'i', 'n', 's')
print(t[0])  # l
print(t[1:3])  # ('u', 'p')

# replace one tuple with another:
t = ('A',) + t[1:]
print(t)  # ('A', 'u', 'p', 'i', 'n', 's')

# COMPARING TUPLES
print((0, 1, 2) < (0, 3, 4))  # TRUE
print((0, 1, 2) < (0, 1, 1000))  # TRUE

# This feature lends itself to a pattern called DSU for:
# - Decorate a sequence by building a list of tuples with one or more sort keys preceding the elements from the sequence,
# - Sort the list of tuples using the Python built-in sort, and
# - Undecorate by extracting the sorted elements of the sequence.

# Dictionaries and tuples
# Dictionaries have a method called items that returns a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair:
d = {'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22}
t = list(d.items())

# output the contents of a dictionary sorted by key

print(t)  # [('b', 1), ('a', 10), ('c', 22)]
t.sort()

# Multiple assignment with dictionaries

# Dictionaries have a method called ITEMS that returns a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair:

# Using tuples as keys in dictionaries
# Because tuples are hashable and lists are not, if we want to create a composite key to use in a dictionary we must use a tuple as the key.

# there are a few cases where you might prefer tuples:
# 1. In some contexts, like a return statement, it is syntactically simpler to create a tuple than a list. In other contexts, you might prefer a list.
# 2. If you want to use a sequence as a dictionary key, you have to use an immutable type like a tuple or string.
# 3. If you are passing a sequence as an argument to a function, using tuples reduces the potential for unexpected behavior due to aliasing.

# Because tuples are immutable, they donâ€™t provide methods like sort and reverse,
# which modify existing lists. However Python provides the built-in functions sorted
# and reversed, which take any sequence as a parameter and return a new sequence
# with the same elements in a different order.

# List comprehension
# convert a list of strings into numbers that you can sum up, you would write
